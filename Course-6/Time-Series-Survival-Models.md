COURSE 6: Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis
========================================================
This course introduces you to additional topics in Machine Learning that complement essential tasks, including forecasting and analyzing censored data. You will learn how to find analyze data with a time component and censored data that needs outcome inference. You will learn a few techniques for Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis. The hands-on section of this course focuses on using best practices and verifying assumptions derived from Statistical Learning.

By the end of this course you should be able to:
* Identify common modeling challenges with time series data
* Explain how to decompose Time Series data: trend, seasonality, and residuals
* Explain how autoregressive, moving average, and ARIMA models work
* Understand how to select and implement various Time Series models
* Describe hazard and survival modeling approaches
* Identify types of problems suitable for survival analysis

### Who should take this course?
This course targets aspiring data scientists interested in acquiring hands-on experience with Time Series Analysis and Survival Analysis.
 
### What skills should you have?
To make the most out of this course, you should have familiarity with programming on a Python development environment, as well as fundamental understanding of Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Supervised Machine Learning, Unsupervised Machine Learning, Probability, and Statistics.

Part 1: Introduction to Time Series Analysis
=======================================
This module introduces the concept of forecasting and why Time Series Analysis is best suited for forecasting, compared to other regression models you might already know. 
You will learn the main components of a Time Series and how to use decomposition models to make accurate time series models.

Part 2: Stationarity and Time Series Smoothing
=======================================
This module introduces you to the concepts of stationarity and Time Series smoothing. 
Having a Time Series that is stationary is easy to model. You will learn how to identify and solve non-stationarity. 
Smoothing is relevant to you as it will help improve the accuracy of your models.

Part 3: ARMA and ARIMA Models
=======================================
This module introduces moving average models, which are the main pillar of Time Series analysis. 
You will first learn the theory behind Autoregressive Models and gain some practice coding ARMA models. Then you will extend your knowledge to use SARMA and SARIMA models as well.

Part 4: Deep Learning and Survival Analysis Forecasts
=======================================
This module introduces two additional tools for forecasting: Deep Learning and Survival Analysis. 
In addition to AI and Machine Learning applications, Deep Learning is also used for forecasting. 
Survival Analysis is a branch of Statistics first ideated to analyze hazard functions and the expected time for an event such as mechanical failure or death to happen. 
Survival Analysis is still used widely in the pharmaceutical industry and also in other business scenarios with limited data related to censoring, the lack of information on whether an event occurred or not for a certain observation.
