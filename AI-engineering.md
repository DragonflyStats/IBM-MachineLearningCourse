Course 1 Machine Learning with Python
======================================================================

This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 

In this course, we will be reviewing two main components:
First, you will be learning about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
Second, you will get a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

In this course, you practice with real-life examples of Machine learning and see how it affects society in ways you may not have guessed!

By just putting in a few hours a week for the next few weeks, this is what you’ll get.
1) New skills to add to your resume, such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn and SciPy 
2) New projects that you can add to your portfolio, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
3) And a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency, and share it anywhere you like online or offline, such as LinkedIn profiles and social media.

If you choose to take this course and earn the Coursera course certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge upon successful completion of the course.

Course 2 Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras
======================================================================

Looking to start a career in Deep Learning? Look no further. This course will introduce you to the field of deep learning and help you answer many questions that people are asking nowadays, like what is deep learning, and how do deep learning models compare to artificial neural networks? You will learn about the different deep learning models and build your first deep learning model using the Keras library.

After completing this course, learners will be able to:
* 	describe what a neural network is, what a deep learning model is, and the difference between them.
* 	demonstrate an understanding of unsupervised deep learning models such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines.
* 	demonstrate an understanding of supervised deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent networks.
* 	build deep learning models and networks using the Keras library.

Course 3 Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing
======================================================================

Computer Vision is one of the most exciting fields in Machine Learning and AI. It has applications in many industries, such as self-driving cars, robotics, augmented reality, and much more. In this beginner-friendly course, you will understand computer vision and learn about its various applications across many industries.

As part of this course, you will utilize Python, Pillow, and OpenCV for basic image processing and perform image classification and object detection.

This is a hands-on course and involves several labs and exercises. Labs will combine Jupyter Labs and Computer Vision Learning Studio (CV Studio), a free learning tool for computer vision. CV Studio allows you to upload, train, and test your own custom image classifier and detection models.  At the end of the course, you will create your own computer vision web app and deploy it to the Cloud.

This course does not require any prior Machine Learning or Computer Vision experience. However, some knowledge of the Python programming language and high school math is necessary.

Course 4: Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch
======================================================================

The course will teach you how to develop deep learning models using  Pytorch. The course will start with Pytorch's  tensors and Automatic differentiation package. Then each section will cover different models starting off with fundamentals such as Linear Regression, and logistic/softmax regression. Followed by  Feedforward deep neural networks, the role of different activation functions, normalization and dropout layers. Then Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer learning will be covered. Finally, several other Deep learning methods will be covered.

### Learning Outcomes:
After completing this course, learners will be able to:
* 	explain and apply their knowledge of Deep Neural Networks and related machine learning methods
* 	know how to use Python libraries such as PyTorch  for Deep Learning applications 
* 	build Deep Neural Networks using PyTorch

Course 5: Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow
======================================================================

The majority of data in the world is unlabeled and unstructured. Shallow neural networks cannot easily capture relevant structure in, for instance, images, sound, and textual data. Deep networks are capable of discovering hidden structures within this type of data. In this course you’ll use TensorFlow library to apply deep learning to different data types in order to solve real world problems.

### Learning Outcomes:
After completing this course, learners will be able to:
* 	explain foundational TensorFlow concepts such as the main functions, operations and the execution pipelines. 
* 	describe how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. 
* 	understand different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.
* 	apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained.


Course 6: AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning
======================================================================
In this capstone, learners will apply their deep learning knowledge and expertise to a real world challenge.  They will use a library of their choice to develop and test a deep learning model. They will load and pre-process data for a real problem, build the model and validate it. Learners  will then present a project report to demonstrate the validity of their model and their proficiency in the field of Deep Learning.

### Learning Outcomes:
* 	determine what kind of deep learning method to use in which situation
* 	know how to build a deep learning model to solve a real problem 
* 	master the process of creating  a deep learning pipeline 
* 	apply knowledge of deep learning to improve models using real data
* 	demonstrate ability to present and communicate outcomes of deep learning projects
